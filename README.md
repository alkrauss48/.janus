This is a collection of the support files I use with the Janus
distrubition. They are in this folder because the main core of Janus
should never be touched if you want to keep it updated.

Install Janus via:

$ curl -Lo- http://bit.ly/janus-bootstrap | bash

Then clone this repo somewhere on your drive (it doesn't matter where)
Once cloned, run the command:

$ bash init.sh

Your Vim should now be awesome.
