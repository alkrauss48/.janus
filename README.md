# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles++

These files are additions to [Thoughtbot's dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles)

Please see installation instructions for their dotfiles on their repo readme.

Tools that are set here are:

* Vim
* Zsh & aliases
* Tmux
* Git config
* Gemrc

In addition to Tmux, I also use the [tmuxinator
gem](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator). You'll need to install this gem
to make use of this tool, but it's pretty sick in that you can pre-set your tmux
sessions to load up with certain pane layouts AND default commands to be run.
